# Sales Performance Data Analysis

This repository contains the steps and code used for performing sales performance data analysis. The analysis process is broken down into several stages, from data transformation to visualization in Power BI.

## Overview

This project aims to analyze sales performance data by transforming, merging, and visualizing data using Power Query and Power BI.

## Steps

1. **Data Transformation**  
   The raw sales data is first transformed using Power Query. This involves:
   - Cleaning the data
   - Formatting and structuring the data as needed for analysis

2. **Data Merging**  
   After transformation, multiple data sources or tables are merged to create a single comprehensive dataset that includes all the relevant sales performance metrics.

3. **Building Relationships**  
   Relationships are created between different tables within the data model to ensure accurate analysis and reporting.

4. **Data Visualization**  
   Power BI is used to create visualizations and dashboards to present the sales performance metrics, including:
   - Sales by region
   - Performance trends over time
   - Key performance indicators (KPIs)

## Requirements

- **Power BI**: For visualizations and reporting
- **Power Query**: For data transformation and cleaning
- **Data Source(s)**: Sales performance data (CSV, Excel, or any other relevant format)
